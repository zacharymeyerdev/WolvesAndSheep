# WolvesAndSheep
This is a program meant to go through the wolves and sheep problem.

wolves and sheep
n wolves and m sheep need to cross a river
there is one boat that can hold two animals at a time
the boat can hold two sheep, two wolves, or one sheep and one wolf
the boat can choose to drop off or not drop off any number of animals on either side
if there is ever more wolves than sheep on one side of the river, all of the sheep will be eaten
if the problem is unsolvable, return null

a cool algorithm i thought of upon hearing the puzzle, and i'm going to solve it
